# **🐲 dragonpilot - Bringing the Spirit of the Dragon to Your Car**

**Join us on a smarter, more thoughtful driving journey.**

## **👋 Welcome, friend!**

`dragonpilot` was launched in 2019 by three early openpilot enthusiasts from the Chinese community. Our mission was simple: create a friendly space for users to share experiences, provide easier setup help, and add features tailored for local needs.

Localization has always been at the heart of what we do—starting with a fully Chinese interface. This made `dragonpilot` quickly popular in Chinese-speaking regions and helped our user base grow into one of the largest worldwide. That community support is what keeps us moving forward.

Built on top of the powerful [openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot)—an open-source driver assistance system rated by Consumer Reports as outperforming commercial offerings—we add localized refinements and user-focused features to create a driving companion that truly fits your needs. (You can also see the [original openpilot README](README_OPENPILOT.md) preserved in our repo.)

The name `dragonpilot` reflects our vision: like the dragon of mythology, it is strong and wise, guarding your safety on the road. In Chinese culture, the dragon is also a symbol of luck and strength, representing our roots and pride.

## **✨ Milestones**

Beyond carrying forward openpilot's core strengths, we've reached several milestones inspired by community feedback:

* **🚘 Always Lane Keep Assist (ALKA)**

  More than a feature—it's part of the `dragonpilot` philosophy. Introduced as early as [version 0.6.2](https://github.com/dragonpilot-community/dragonpilot/blob/2861467183d62151024320447ba04d18fc3fe1e6/selfdrive/car/toyota/carstate.py#L199), first tested on a 2017 Lexus IS300h, then expanded to Toyota's lineup and beyond. ALKA helps keep your vehicle steadily centered, giving you extra confidence on the road.

* **🌐 First to add multilingual support**

  Before openpilot officially supported it, we had already introduced multiple languages. `dragonpilot` fully supports Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, and English.

* **💻 Only community fork to support multiple hardware platforms at once**

  We uniquely worked to make the project run on EON, comma two, comma 3, and Jetson—serving the widest range of users possible.
  Additionally, after the comma.ai team deprecated the comma 3 in version 0.10.0, we remain the only community fork to offer full, simultaneous support for the comma 3, comma 3X, and the O3, O3L, and O3XL (the O3 series being third-party hardware).

* **📜 Once recognized as the #1 openpilot fork**

  Thanks to an active community and continuous innovation, `dragonpilot` was once the largest openpilot fork officially recognized by comma ai. This honor belongs to everyone who contributed.

## **🧑‍💻 Design Philosophy - Less is More**

As openpilot's AI grows stronger, many features that once required manual tuning are now handled by advanced models. That's why our focus has returned to **“minimal changes.”**

We aim to give you the purest, most official-like openpilot driving experience—while preserving `dragonpilot`'s classic, community-loved features. With a solid AI foundation, simplicity is strength.

## **🛠️ Hardware Journey**

From the early **EON**, to official devices like **comma two / three (C2/C3/C3X)**, to creative community builds (**C1.5, O2, O3, O3L, O3XL, etc.**), and even experiments with [**Jetson Xavier NX**](https://github.com/eFiniLan/xnxpilot).

Currently, the latest versions support: **comma3 / 3X** and community hardware like **O3 / O3L / O3XL**.
Older devices such as **EON / C1.5 / C2** are supported in the [d2 branch](https://github.com/dragonpilot-community/dragonpilot/tree/d2).
Whatever device you're on, it represents your passion for open-source driver assistance.

### **Safety Notice**

`dragonpilot` is a driver **assistance** system, not full self-driving. It reduces fatigue and improves safety, but you must remain alert and ready to take control at all times. Always follow your local traffic laws.

**Thanks again for being here.**

**We look forward to riding the “dragon” with you on the road to smarter driving!**
